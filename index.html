  <h1>Nutrition</h1>
  <!-- Project -->
  <div id="definition">
    <p><strong>Nutrition</strong> is process by which organisms obtain, consume and utilise food to maintain life processes
    </p>
    <p>
      Some organisms obtain already made food from others while some manufacture their own .After consuming the food, it is utilised in different ways in the body.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="modes">
    <h2>
      <i>
       <u>Modes of nutrition</u>
        </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two modes of nutrition namely;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
       Autotrophic nutrition 
      </li>
      <li>Heterotrophic nutrition</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Autotrophic nutrition</h3>
    <p>
      This is where organisms manufacture or synthesize their own food using a specific form of energy.Organisms that make their own food are called autotrophs.
    </p>
    <img  class='image' src="Autotrophic.jpg" alt="autotrophic nutrition"  width="585" height="300">
    <p>
      Autotrophs are divided into two groups according to the energy used when makng their own food ie; 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Photosynthesis
      </li>
      <li>
        Chemosynthesis
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Photosynthesis
    </h4>
    <p>
      Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms make their own food using sunlight energy. Organisms that make their food by photosynthesis and called phototrophs.examples include;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        greenplant
      </li>
      <li>
        algae
      </li>
      <li>
        photosynthetic bacteria
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Chemosynthesis
    </h4>
    <p>
      This is a process whereby organisms manufacture organic food materials using energy from specific chemical reactions known as oxidation reactions. Organisms that carryout chemosynthesis are called chemotrophs and examples in include;
    </p>
    
    <img src="Chemosynthesis.jpg" alt="chemosynthesis" width="585" height="300" class="chemo">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Nitrosomonas
      </li>
      <li>
        Sulphur colorless bacteria
      </li>
      <li>
        Nitrococcus
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      NB: Oxidation reactions are exothermic reactions which means they give out heat as a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      NH4(aq)+O2(g) -> NO2(aq)+H2O(l)+ heat
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Heterotrophic nutrition
    </h3>
    <p>
    This is a mode of nutrition whose organisms obtain already manufactured food from other organisms hence they can't make their own food.And they can be divided into;
    </p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>
      Parasitism
    </li>
    <li>
      Mutualism
    </li>
    <li>
      Phagocytosis nutrition
    </li>
    <li>
      Saprophytism nutrition
    </li>
    <li>
      Holozoic nutrition
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Parasitism
  </h4>
  <p>This is a form of nutrition relationships between organisms of different species where one organism(parasite) benefits nutritionally and the other (host) suffers harm eg.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ticks in cows
    </li>
    <li>
      tapeworms in a cow,pigs and humans
    </li>
    <li>
      liverflukes in a sheep
    </li>
    <li>
      mosquitoes on human beings
    </li>
    <li>
      caterpillar on leaves of plants 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Mutualism
  </h4>
  <p>
    This is a nutritional relationship between organisms of different species where both organisms benefit from from the relationship eg. Lichen, a relationship between an algae and fungi.
  </p>
  <img src="lichen.jpg" alt="lichen" class="<lichen" width="585" height="400"
  <h4>
    Phagocytosis
  </h4>
  <p>
    This is a form of nutrition where the organism engulfs food particles. This is common in unicellular organisms like paramecium,amoeba etc. During phagocytosis, intracellular digestion takesplace ie it happens inside cells.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Saprophytism
  </h4>
  <p>
    This is a form of nutrition where organisms feed on decomposing or decaying matter.Examples include bacteria,moulds,mushrooms.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Holozoic nutrition
  </h4>
  <p>
    This is a form of nutrition where the organisms takes in food, break it down into simpler substances which are absorbed and utilised the body. Organisms that undergo holozoic nutrition are divided into three;
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Carnivores
    </li>
  </ul>
    <p>
      These are organisms that only feed on flesh.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Herbivores
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    There are organisms that feed entirely on vegetation eg. goats,cows,sheep.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Omnivores
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These are organisms that feed on both flesh and vegetation.examples include; man, pigs, rats etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    NB: Important terms used in nutrition 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Ingestion; This refers to the taking in of food int the body.
    </li>
    <li>
      Digestion; This is the breakdown of food into simpler substances that can be absorbed in the body.
    </li>
    <li>
      Absorption; This is the process where digested food is taken into the cells of the body.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assimilation; This utilizing of the absobed food where is is turned into energy.
    </li>

    <h3>
        Types of food
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are seven different types of food classes eg.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Carbohydrates
        </li>
        <p>
          These are energy giving foods and examples include;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            cassava
          </li>
          <li>
            rice
          </li>
          <li>
            wheat
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
          Vitamins 
        </li>
        <p>
          These are foods that boost bodies immunity eg.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vitamin K from green vegetables like spinach, cabbage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitamin D from egg yolk, margarine and action of sunlight on skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vitamin A from fish,liver oil,carrots.
            
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Proteins
        </li"">
        <p>
          These are body building foods and examples include;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            beans
          </li>
          <li>
            beef
          </li>
          <li>
            chicken
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Mineral salts
        </li>
        <p>
          These are also immunity boosting foods. They are also required in small quantities for normal body growth.Examples include;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Calcium: This helps in formation of strong bones and teeth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Iron: Formation of haemoglobin in red blood cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chlorine: Formation of hydrochloric acid in gastric juice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
          Roughages
        </li>
        <p>
          This is indigestible cellulose from plant cell walls. They stimulate peristalysis in the intestines.
        </p>
        <li>
          Lipids(fats and oils)
        </li>
        <p>
          These works as energy reserves in animals,seeds and fruits. Examples include meat, groundnuts.
        </p>
        
        <li>
          Water
        </li>
        <p>
          Without water, life couldn't exist on Earth. It is used in a lot of processes which include
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            photosynthesis
          </li>
          <li>
            Translocation
          </li>
          <li>
            osmoregulation etc.
